/**
 * Utility functions for interacting with the file system.
 *
 * These are a few simple syscall wrappers for file system interaction. The
 * design here follows a few simple rules:
 * - Short names that closely resemble well-known *nix shell commands, e.g.
 *   "rm -rf" becomes rmrf(), there's cd() etc.
 * - Simple interfaces in favor of micro-optimization. For example, there might
 *   be a future ls() call that returns a vector of strings rather than a file
 *   system iterator.
 * - Syscall errors result in exceptions (unless otherwise noted in the function
 *   documentation), so make sure to catch them if necessary (i.e. in core bot
 *   code).
