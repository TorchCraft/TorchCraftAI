/**
 * The main bot object for training scenarios.
 *
 * This class is used to play StarCraft Broodwar (TM) via the TorchCraft bridge.
 * The behavior and actions of the player are determined by a user-supplied list
 * of bot modules.
 *
 * In contrast to Player, this class does not provide convenience methods for
 * initializing a game and running it until the end -- it's assumed that users
 * of this class handle this. Instead, onGameStart() and onGameEnd() are
 * exposed, which call the respective functions of all bot modules that have
 * been added to the player. The rationale for this is to enable repeated
 * usage or instantiation of MicroPlayers during a single TorchCraft session.
