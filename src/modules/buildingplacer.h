/**
 * Determines positions for buildings.
 *
 * For buildings that require a worker to build them, BuilderModule requires the
 * UPC to specify a Dirac position. This module's job is to determine suitable
 * positions based on an existing distribution over positions and various
 * heuristics (via builderhelpers).
 *
 * Optionally, BuildingPlacerModel can be used for building placement. The model
 * location is specified via the -bp_model command-line flag; if a valid model
 * is found at the specified location, it will be loaded and used. If GPU
 * support is available, the model will be run on the GPU.
 *
 * ProxyTasks are used to track execution of the downstream production task. If
 * the production task will fail (e.g. because the location became unbuildable),
 * retries will be attempted until the ProxyTask is cancelled (e.g. from an
 * upstream module).
 *
 * This module will also reserve build tiles as unbuildable via TilesInfo.
