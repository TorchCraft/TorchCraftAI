/**
 * A building placement module with reinforcement learning support.
 *
 * The module can be run with either a trainer instance (`setTrainer()`) or just
 * a model (`setModel()`). With a trainer, action selection is done by the
 * trainer (e.g., argmax for evaluation mode); without a trainer, the module
 * will use sample an action from the model output if the model is in training
 * mode, or select the action with maximum probability in evaluation mode.
 *
 * The built-in placement rules are used to pre-select the desired area for
 * placement, which is then supplied to the featurizer (`BuildingPlacerSample`).
 * UPCs from this module will be posted with `RLBPUpcData` instances which
 * contain information regarding the input data, validity and outcome of each
 * action. However, note that if `UpcStorage` is used in non-persistent mode,
 * the post data will not be saved.
 *
 * By default, the module will attempt to load a building placer model from the
 * location specified by the `--rlbp_model` command-line flag. If it cannot find
 * a model, operation will fall back to use the built-in rules from the
 * builderhelpers namespace.
