 * Off policy policy gradient with a critic.
 * This Trainer implements two modes:
 * - Online:
 *     It does 1 update with the given batch size per node whenever it gets an
 *     episode. Therefore, one episode will always be new and the others will
 *     be from the replay buffer. THIS MODE IS UNTESTED
 * - Offline:
 *     Many threads are assumed to generate episodes in the background, and
 *     it does updates in a seperate background thread.
 * In both modes, it will first update on new episodes at least once before
 * moving to sample from the replay buffer. If more episodes are generated than
 * it can update, it will block until the next update. When the replaybuffer of
 * episodes it has already updated over reaches maxBatchSize, it will remove
 * the oldest episode it's seen.
 *
 * Replayer format:
 *   state, action, p(action), reward
 *
 * Model output:
 *   Probability vector over actions: 1-dim Vector
 *   Critic's value estimate: Double
